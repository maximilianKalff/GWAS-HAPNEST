# HAPNEST GWAS – Ancestry-Specific Genome-Wide Association Study

This repository contains all relevant code, documentation, and results for our project in the course **Biomedical Data Types** at Hasso Plattner Institute. 

The project focuses on performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the synthetic HAPNEST dataset. We analyze genetic associations separately for two ancestry groups – European (EUR) and African (AFR) – and combine the results through meta-analysis. The goal is to explore ancestry-specific patterns in genetic data and assess how population structure impacts GWAS outcomes.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository and set up a python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download PLINK into the project folder.
4. Download the HAPNEST dataset manually into data/raw/.
5. Run the preprocessing, QC and GWAS for both ancestries `AFR` and `EUR`.
6. Run the meta analysis.
7. Create plots & visualizations with `03_results_visualization.ipynb`.

## Tools Used

- PLINK v1.9 – for QC, GWAS, and meta-analysis (Slifer, 2018)
- Python 3.11 – data handling and preprocessing
- libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
- Jupyter Notebook – reproducible workflow and step-by-step analysis
